lnkbackup

lnkbackup is a backup utility based on rsync, written in PHP. lnkbackup creates
incremental snapshots using rsnync's --link-dest ability. Also, it creates
entries using the date (2019-01-01) as name and it creates weekly, monthly and
yearly snapshots using YYYY-MM-DD.weekly, .monthly and .yearly as suffix each
Sunday or first of month/week.

lnkbackup allows to define several backup jobs in one directory, which are
processed consecutively.

Apart from that, lnkbackup offers several programs aimed at administering
backup sets:

	*lnkbackup - the backup script
	*lnkcopy - copy a backup to another location
	*lnktrim - remove older backup entries
	*lnkusage - track the usage of space over several entries
